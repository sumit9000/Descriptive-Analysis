🔍 What You'll Find Inside
---
1. Descriptive Statistics
   
Compute mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for numerical columns like Volume, Avg Price, Discount Rate (%).

Interpret trends: High variability in sales? Skewed discounts? We've got the numbers!

2. Data Visualizations

Histograms: Spot distributions and skewness (e.g., right-skewed sales volumes).

Boxplots: Hunt down outliers and understand interquartile ranges.

Bar Charts: Break down categorical data like BU (Business Unit), Brand, and Model.

Example Insight: Discounts spike on certain days—perfect for marketing strategies!

3. Data Preprocessing
   
Standardization (Z-Score): Scale numerical features for ML readiness. Before/after comparisons included.

One-Hot Encoding: Transform categories into dummy variables (e.g., Day_Thursday as binary flags).

Why? Prevents model bias and handles non-numeric data seamlessly.

4. Key Findings & Conclusion

Summarized insights on data patterns, preprocessing importance, and ML prep.

Reflection: Without these steps, your models could flop—learn why!
