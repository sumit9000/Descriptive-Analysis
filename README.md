## 🔍 What You’ll Find Inside

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

- Compute **mean**, **median**, **mode**, and **standard deviation** for numerical columns (Volume, Avg Price, Discount Rate (%)).
- Interpret trends: High variability in sales? Skewed discounts? The numbers reveal all.

### 2. Data Visualizations

- **Histograms:** Spot distributions and skewness (e.g., right-skewed sales volumes).
- **Boxplots:** Hunt down outliers and understand interquartile ranges.
- **Bar Charts:** Break down categorical data—BU (Business Unit), Brand, Model.
- *Example Insight:* Discounts spike on certain days—essential for marketing strategies!

### 3. Data Preprocessing

- **Standardization (Z-Score):** Scale numerical features for machine learning; see before/after effects.
- **One-Hot Encoding:** Convert categories to dummy variables (e.g., Day_Thursday as binary flags).
- *Why?* Prevents model bias and seamlessly handles non-numeric data.

### 4. Key Findings & Conclusion

- Summarized insights on data patterns and preprocessing importance.
- *Reflection:* Without these steps, ML models may flop—learn why!
